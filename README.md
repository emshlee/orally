<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The "Assessment of Orofacial Pain and Symptoms" app is designed to address the oral health disparities that exist in our society and promote oral health equity. Many individuals hesitate to visit the dentist due to dentophobia or the high cost of treatments, resulting in inadequate oral health management. This app aims to empower users by providing them with a reliable assessment tool for orofacial pain and related conditions.

**While the app does not provide a definitive diagnosis, it empowers users to understand their symptoms and guides them toward seeking appropriate professional medical care.**
